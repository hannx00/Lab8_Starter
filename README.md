# Lab 8 - Starter


1) Manually run them locally before pushing code
Because the project has many components, it is the most optimal to test each feature thoroughly in a local server before implementing a new one. Ideally,
the tests will be written after completing the function, so we will know right away if it works as expected before pushing code.
2) Yes
3) No because of the limitation of unit testing(Cannot test how these individual components interact with each other on an application/feature level). Testing the send feature requires us to interact with the components before and after sending the texts.
4) Yes because the max length is simply a requirement of the input. Since it doesn't involve interacting with other components, unit testing would be fitting here.
